The first sorting algorithm is the bubble sort, which starts at the beginning of the array and 'bubbles up' 
unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.





The last sorting algorithm you will implement is the insertion sort. 
This algorithm works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of the list. It begins the sorted array with the first element. 
Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backward into the sorted array until it is in a sorted position, and so on.
