The first sorting algorithm is the bubble sort, which starts at the beginning of the array and 'bubbles up' 
unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.

const bubbleSort = (array) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length - 1; j++) {
      if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
        const temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j + 1];
        array[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }

  return array;
}


//********//
This time, you'll be implementing a selection sort. 
Selection sort works by finding the smallest value in the array, then swapping it with the first value in the array. 
Then, it finds the next smallest value in the array, and swaps it with the second value in the array. 
It continues iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.


const selectionSort = (array) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    let minIndex = i;

    for (let j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
      if (array[j] < array[minIndex]) {
        minIndex = j;
      }
    }

    const temp = array[i];
    array[i] = array[minIndex];
    array[minIndex] = temp;
  }

  return array;
}


//****************//
The last sorting algorithm you will implement is the insertion sort. 
This algorithm works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of the list. It begins the sorted array with the first element. 
Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backward into the sorted array until it is in a sorted position, and so on.

const insertionSort = (array) => {
  for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
    const currValue = array[i];
    let j = i - 1;

    while (j >= 0 && array[j] > currValue) {
      array[j + 1] = array[j];
      j--;
    }
    array[j + 1] = currValue;
  }
  return array;
}

//*******//
The callback to .sort() should return a number. That number determines how to sort the elements a and b:

If the number is negative, sort a before b.
If the number is positive, sort b before a.
If the number is zero, do not change the order of a and b.
Keeping in mind that you want the numbers to be sorted in ascending order (smallest to largest), 
return a single subtraction calculation using a and b that will correctly sort the numbers with the above logic.


const sortedValues = inputValues.sort((a, b) => {
    return a - b;
  });


//*******************************************************************************//
.map() method takes a callback function as its first argument. 
This callback function takes a few arguments, but the first one is the current element being processed. 
The callback function needs to return a value. In this case, you want to return the value of each element converted to a number. 
You can do this by using the Number() constructor, passing the element as an argument.

const calculate = () => {
  const value = document.querySelector("#numbers").value;
  const array = value.split(/,\s*/g);
  const numbers = array.map();
}
