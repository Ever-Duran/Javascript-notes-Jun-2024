Regular expressions can take flags to modify their behavior. 
For instance, the i flag can be used to make the expression ignore case, 
causing it to match hello, HELLO, and Hello for the expression /hello/.

Flags are added after the trailing slash. Add the i flag to your helpRegex.
const helpRegex = /please help/i;
