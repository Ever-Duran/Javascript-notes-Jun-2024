These are some JS notes about courses Some code lines and notes are taken from freecodecamp.org. so I don't own the rights. However, I'm just writing for future references.
 To get the last element of any array, you can use the following syntax:


//
array[array.length - 1]
//


***Example : to update the last element of an array
//let cities = [ "Los Angeles", "Glendale", "Pasadena" ];
console.log(cities);
cities[cities.length - 1]= "California";
console.log(cities);
//

**In order to access an HTML element we used the getElementByID() method.

**is and has can help us out assign boolean value to a variable
Example Code
let isRunning = true;
let hasCompleted = false;

***
.replace() allows you to replace characters in a string with another string
This method can take two arguments. The first one is the element to be replaced and the second is the string that will be replacing the matched sequence.

the g flag, stands for "global"
const regex = /[+-\s]/g;
*the i flag, which stands for "insensitive".
Example Code

/Hello/i
This includes any E in hello : hEllo, HELLO, Hello, hello, etc

*Prevent  1e10
function isInvalidInput(str) {
  const regex = /[0-9]e[0-9]/i;
}
