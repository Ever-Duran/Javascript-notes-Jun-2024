These are some JS notes about courses Some code lines and notes are taken from freecodecamp.org. I'm just writing for future references.
 To get the last element of any array, you can use the following syntax:


//
array[array.length - 1]
//


***Example : to update the last element of an array
//let cities = [ "Los Angeles", "Glendale", "Pasadena" ];
console.log(cities);
cities[cities.length - 1]= "California";
console.log(cities);
//

**In order to access an HTML element we used the getElementByID() method.

**is and has can help us out assign boolean value to a variable
Example Code
let isRunning = true;
let hasCompleted = false;

***
.replace() allows you to replace characters in a string with another string
This method can take two arguments. The first one is the element to be replaced and the second is the string that will be replacing the matched sequence.

the g flag, stands for "global"
const regex = /[+-\s]/g;
*the i flag, which stands for "insensitive".
Example Code

/Hello/i
This includes any E in hello : hEllo, HELLO, Hello, hello, etc

*Prevent  1e10
function isInvalidInput(str) {
  const regex = /[0-9]e[0-9]/i;
}

**
Template literals interpolate variables directly within a string
e.g. const name = "Daniel";
const templateLiteral = Hello, my name is ${name}~!;
console.log(templateLiteral);

The console will show the string "Hello, my name is Daniel~!".
**

*In order to access an HTML with an Id you can use getElementById()
*To match specific characters in a string you can use "regex" - (it stands for Regular Expression)
const regex = /Hello/;

**
.replace() 
it can take two arguments
1. The element to be replaced
2. The string that replaces the matched sequence.
e.g "hello".replace(/l/g, "1")

g means global
i means insensitive

shorthard character: \d covers any digit character from 0-10.

.querySelectorAll() returns a NodeList that matches the selector.


*To check new HTML content you use innerHTML.
formElement.innerHTML += formContent;
-
forgetInputContainer.innerHTML += HTMLString;

**
.alert() is used to pop-up a message

**
preventDefault()
to prevent a default effect or action
