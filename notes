These are some JS notes about courses Some code lines and notes are taken from freecodecamp.org. so I don't own the rights. However, I'm just writing for future references.
 To get the last element of any array, you can use the following syntax:


//
array[array.length - 1]
//


***Example : to update the last element of an array
//let cities = [ "Los Angeles", "Glendale", "Pasadena" ];
console.log(cities);
cities[cities.length - 1]= "California";
console.log(cities);
//

**In order to access an HTML element we used the getElementByID() method.

**is and has can help us out assign boolean value to a variable
Example Code
let isRunning = true;
let hasCompleted = false;
