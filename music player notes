How to create an array?
const allSongs = [];
How to add an object?
const allSongs = [
{ id : 2;
}
]

*************
spread operator (...) allows you to copy an array
e.g.
let usersData = {
    list : [...allSongs],
};


**
arrow functions don't have a name. 
e.g : () => {}

to create a name you can assign the function to a variable :
e.g. const sum = () => {
//code
}

we call this function as a regular one
***

arrow functions can accept multiple parameters
you can delete the brackets if the funcion only has one parameter
e.g. const sum = (name) => {
}
---
const sum = name => {
}
if the arrow function returns one expression, you can skip including the return and {}.


* the map() method is used to iterate through an array and return a new array.
-map() takes a function as an argument, this is called callback function.

const songsHTML = array.map((song) => {});

* join() method is used to concatenate all rlements of an array into a single string.
it can take a "separate" argument which works to separate the elements in the array.


In order to change multiple methods you can call the join() on the results lf the map()
e.g. : array.map().join();

*Optional Chaining (?) it prevents errors when you access a nested property
that may be null or undefined.

*sort() converts elements of an array into strings and sorts them.
(you must create a conditional if to use this method)/

* .find() searches the first element in an array that matches a condition.

*indexOf() returns the first index at which a previous element can be found.

* add() adds a new element to a set.

* forEach() it's used to loop through an array and performs a function on each element.

* removeAttribute() removes an attribute from an element.

* setAttribute() assigns an attribute to an element.

* textContent() sets the text of a Node and allows tou to set or retrieve the text of an html élément.

randomize an array
- names.sort(() => Math.random() -0.5);

* filter() keeps the elemenets of an array that satisfy the call back function passed to it.

* createElement() Dom method. You can use it to create a new element. 
e.g. document.createElement('div')

* textNode() creates a text node. To use it you call it and pass it in the next as a string.

* element.id can add an id to an element.

*appendChild() adds a node or an element as the child of another element.
