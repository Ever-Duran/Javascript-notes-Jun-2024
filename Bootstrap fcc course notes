Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers


Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. 
It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

**********************************************************

** Add the "img-responsive" class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page

** For example:
<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
This button would only be as wide as the word Submit.

** With the additional class of btn-block, 
The button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and 
any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.

<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>

**The "btn-primary" class is the main color you'll use in your app. 
It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.

**The "btn-info" class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.
<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
<button class = "btn btn-primary btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
