Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers


Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. 
It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

**********************************************************

** Add the "img-responsive" class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page

** For example:
<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
This button would only be as wide as the word Submit.

** With the additional class of btn-block, 
The button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and 
any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.

<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>

**The "btn-primary" class is the main color you'll use in your app. 
It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.

**The "btn-info" class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.
<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
<button class = "btn btn-primary btn-block btn-info">Info</button>

**The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a photo.

*******************************************************
Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side

Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows 
and specify each element's relative width. Bootstrap has different column width attributes 
that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is. 

For example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means medium, 
and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. 

In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, 
where xs means extra small and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.

**For images to adapt to the width
<img src="imagen.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Imagen">

//This is no longer available for Bootstrap 4 and 5 so I must use "img-fluid":
<img src="imagen.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Imagen">

**using the inline span element, you can put several elements on the same line, and even style different parts of the same line differently.

*****************************************************
Add Font Awesome Icons to our Buttons

Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons can be webfonts or vector graphics. These icons are treated just like fonts.
You can include Font Awesome in any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css" 
integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf" crossorigin="anonymous">

**The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, but is now commonly used for icons. 
We add the Font Awesome class :  <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>

**We add the thumbs-up, airplane and trash bin icon
<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary"><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i>Like</button>

<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i>Submit</button>

<button class="btn btn-block btn-danger"><i class="fas fa-trash"></i>Delete</button>


**You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements as well.
This way, our radio buttons will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.
Nest both your radio buttons within a <div class="row"> element. 
Then nest each of them within a <div class="col-xs-6"> element.

**Since Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes are applicable to all form elements, 
you can use them on your checkboxes too.

**************
You can add the fa-paper-plane Font Awesome icon by adding <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> 
within your submit button element.
Give your form's text input field a class of form-control. 
Give your form's submit button the classes btn btn-primary. 
Also give this button the Font Awesome icon of fa-paper-plane.

All textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements with the class .form-control have a width of 100%.
