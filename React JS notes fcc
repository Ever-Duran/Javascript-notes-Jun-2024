Create a Simple JSX Element

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript.
*because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX.
//{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }


*It's worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))
